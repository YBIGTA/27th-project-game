257850,194818899,76561198393575497,finished a playthrough without once interacting with an npc the story was conveyed well enough through a few flashbacks that i had no issues with getting invested in the world only figured out half way ish through the game that there might be a shop but i had committed to the whole no talking thing so i finished things up with no upgrades combat is initially tricky but satisfying i plan to do a full no death run in new game plus mode and would say that getting this game is well worth it,True,0,0,0.5,0,True,False,False,Hyper Light Drifter
