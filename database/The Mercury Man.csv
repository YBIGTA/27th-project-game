740200,97067821,76561198029682321, great noir cyberpunk story very gritty but also can be funny in a dark way  my only gripe with it is the driving mechanic which is not fun at all going from one point to the next feels like a chore but it is what it is  combat aint fun but just smoke some cigarrettes and buy a good gun and youre perfect  low budget high passion  soundtrack is exactly what i like to hear synthed smooth and wavy,True,3,0,0.5428382754325866,0,True,False,False,The Mercury Man
