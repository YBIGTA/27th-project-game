203830,107084273,76561198021089008,once again daedalic entertainment has created a very cute and fun game with great voice acting fun puzzles and fair entertainment value  you can usually pick it up either in a bundle or for a couple of bucks making it essentially free  i pay more for coffee at starbucks   it is a great game for kids and adults alike  add it to your library,True,0,0,0.5,0,True,False,False,The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav

203830,105148637,76561198000039896,the puzzles are mostly logical and not too hard the main characters are the typical daedalic cast a geek and geeks dream girl i find this rather boring  background graphics are beautiful and so is the music score animations seem to be mostly made by morphing static images the often look a amateurish and unnatural  i recommended the game if you are a fan of the dark eye roleplaying system or of daedalics other adventures,True,0,0,0.5,0,True,False,False,The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav
203830,104972264,76561199181122957,fantastic world building and characters it starts out bit slow and kinda grim but grimness of the setting makes plot more interesting and story really picks up later on this is a great game and it has a sequel called memoria which is even better than chains of satinav i recommend playing both of them great bit of escapism,True,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False,The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav
203830,101324489,76561198046229746,i enjoyed this game the story visuals and voice acting were good the main character looks like a non psycho tigtone it is not an easy game but if you love point  click games and a challenge this one is for you,True,0,0,0.5,0,True,False,False,The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav
203830,99583481,76561198126909754,good old quest beautifully painted with puzzles that make sense most of the time if you have problems with mouse cursor jumping all over the screen go to the installation folder right click the satinavexe  compatibility and play around with scaling option there,True,0,0,0.5,0,True,False,False,The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav
