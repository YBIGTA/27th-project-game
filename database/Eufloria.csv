221180,73764156,76561198003543813,ive had this game for years and ive replayed it many times on pc and android  you really feel the satisfaction when watching your seedlings barrage an enemy outnumbering them 10 to 1 after spending a long game defending yourself against powerful enemies and building up your power slowly  i only wish this game had more combat but the slight randomisation in levels makes the game quite replayable the skirmish and dark matter modes help with that as well,True,0,0,0.5,0,False,False,False,Eufloria
221180,73302293,76561198043689524,this game is odd its kinda relaxing and honestly can be kinda fun but ultimately the stakes are basically nonexistent and it plays much more like a really simple rts set to easiest difficulty its not a bad game but it really feels like an early access version of someones first real game if it really interests you buy it on sale but honestly its hardly notable,False,0,0,0.5,0,True,False,False,Eufloria
