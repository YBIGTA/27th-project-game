251130,137135778,76561199074463202,goated game the theme makes side goals eg kill all minions before final boss attack each turn with x character ect actually make sense instead of being some out of place challenge has a story that ive so far actually paid attention to doubt it has too much replayabilty other than changing the difficulty but i could be wrong,True,0,0,0.5,0,False,False,False,Chroma Squad
