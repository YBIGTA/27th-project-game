460790,198687610,76561199553238595,dont get fooled by positive reviews its literally unplayeble on amd systems   even saw some people having same issues with nvidia cards  its flickering like epilepsy attack in literally first cutscene with dragon   had to manually restart my system order to do something so if you wanna buy this game you might have to wait for patch or driver update but its unlikely with this port being almost 8 years old,False,1,0,0.4988066852092742,0,True,False,False,Bayonetta
460790,198599363,76561198194211403,really good hack n slash gameplay is fluent and fun story music and art is also really good love the gothic vibe they went for  my only complaint is that the transofrmation is two times dodge which makes the gameplay in the latter half of the game alot worse so i recommend maybe modding it to another button or smth really recommend it its really fun and not that long,True,0,0,0.5,0,False,False,False,Bayonetta
