1527950,200498368,76561198026186150,this is a very good game and if you like battle brothers but get bored of it because there is no story line war tales has you covered   a lot of reviews say there is a repetitive game play loop i disagree every region has its own story line and decisions   there is also a rich tactical system crafting system and team customization experience   a little bit of jank here and there on cut scenes but ill look past that,True,0,0,0.5,0,True,False,False,Wartales
1527950,200493608,76561198087883131,even the things that normally would get boring in a game like this ie combats versus the same type of enemies are still just as exciting the 100th time as they are the first  the many layers of troop and facility management are also intriguing  the additions of additional story lines just add more fun and exciting adventures to be had prepare to have multiple hours just disappear from your life every time you sit down to play just for a little while  highly recommend,True,0,0,0.5,0,True,False,False,Wartales
1527950,200448083,76561198020383815,its great at times super frustrating but then again it forces you to really think about how to get past fights you have to use all your resources at times and truly be tactical when your outnumbered and under the gun the depth and layers in the game is amazing i am addicted,True,0,0,0.5,0,True,False,False,Wartales
