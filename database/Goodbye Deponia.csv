241910,106174070,76561199126776009,imho the best part of the trilogy puzzles and tasks are much logically structured than in previous two parts humour remembers the good times when people had freedom to joke without risking to lose their business or social life because someone lacks comfort there are plenty of locations in the game lots of different scenes about different situations happening in real life authors can easily joke about sensitive topics as rufus is charismatic but not morally ideal hero,True,0,0,0.5,0,True,False,False,Goodbye Deponia

241910,100775920,76561198027909343,a somewhat funny poinclick game the achievements are sometimes kinda hard to come by and are not that obvious to get the jokes at least in the original german dub are sometimes a bit questionable when refering to hitler or making somewhat racists jokes but i guess jokes changed over the years with political correctness taking over  overall i would rate it 710,True,0,0,0.5,0,True,False,False,Goodbye Deponia
