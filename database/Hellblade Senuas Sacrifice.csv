414340,197008880,76561198009462423,710 barely a thumbs up for me the atmosphere of this game is one of the best ive ever seen and the constant voices were done astonishingly well combat is ok at best but what really threw me off were these riddles you had to do every time the same it was fine at the beginning of the game but later on it just got way too boring searching for the alignment of runes again and again the atmosphere alone though makes up for everything else so id encourage people to try this out,True,0,0,0.5,0,True,False,False,Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice
