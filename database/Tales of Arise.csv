740130,194589256,76561198043932359,a really good game  the story is quite good and the characters are very likable im not the greatest fan of the combat though however the combat animations especially the combination moves still kept me entertained through it i would recommend not playing on higher difficulties  enemies just become unbelievably tanky and the fights drag on far too long,True,0,0,0.5,0,False,False,False,Tales of Arise
